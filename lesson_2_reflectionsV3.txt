Initialize a repository: creates a .git file.  Not sure
why I need to do it.

Staging area is a temporary holding pen, unlike working directory and repository.  

Use diff to compare the working directory and the staging area to 
see what change was made

Situations where branch keeps thing organized: when redoing a div for a new section of webpage, when making changes to functions

Visualizing branching diagrams does exactly that.
