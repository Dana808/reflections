Initialize a repository: creates a .git file.  Not sure
why I need to do it.

Staging area is a temporary holding pen, unlike working directory and repository.  

Use diff to compare the working directory and the staging area to 
see what change was made

Situations where branch keeps thing organized: when redoing a div for a new section of webpage, when making changes to functions

Visualizing branching diagrams does exactly that.

Result of merging two branches together:  a MESS!  Line 424 was changed in both branches so there was a 
conflict.  Simple solution was to resolve the confilct by choosing the appropriate line, saving the file, then 
committing it to the branch.  However, I was saving to the wrong place and I have no idea where the first two
commits went so had to do a third and finally got that into the right branch and the merge went through fine
Messy.
